## Project Information

- Strong points
  - Versatile as we can toggle the wireframes for every object as well as enable/disable the lights
  - Cameras from you can choose to take a look at the scene and its objects
  - Possibility to change the Fog values and to disable it
  - Light helpers to help visualize the light's position and direction
  - Appealing scene design
  - Variety of primitives and complex objects

  
    As we arrive at the **house** in our **car**, we can see **a big mansion** and some **trees** around it. When crossing the **gate** we can see a well maintained space. The **grass** is cut and the **car** is parked in the **garage**. Looks like there is a **person** in the **garden** drinking a **Fanta**, coming up close looks like a can of **Coke**.
    Just by the entrance door we have an outside space with some **chairs** and a **sunshade**. Entering the **house** the **door opens automatically**.
    Already inside we can see a **staircase** that leads to the second floor, some today's **newspapers** on the diner table with a nice **chandelier** above it.
    Into the cosy second floor we can see a **bed** with a **rounded pillow** .There is **lamp** on the
    **bedside table** and a **video** is playing on the tv. We can also see a **painting** that may confuse you if you look closely. Outside, in the **balcony**, there is a nice **pool filled with water** to have an enjoyable time. Leaving the house we can smell the **smoke** coming from the **chimney** and the farther we are the smoke starts to **dissipate**. The **sun** is shining bright as it is a beautiful day.

## Issues/Problems

- The primitives limited our creativity, as we had to use complex objects to achieve the desired result.
- We prioritized the implementation of every proposed feature while remaining dedicated to designing a visually captivating scene.
