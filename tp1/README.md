- Scene
  
  As we step into the **room**, with a **window** to the outside. It seems it is someone's birthday as there is a **cake** with a **candle** on the **table** right in the hearth of the **room**. The 2 **lamps** fill the room with a comforting ambiance. There are **framed photographs**, on the **walls**, of the individuals that live there, maybe it's the birthday of one of them. A red **carpet** is presented on the floor  and close by there are 2 **projectors** that focus on the pictures of the guys. As it's very sunny outside the **curtains** are partially closed.
  They seem to like cars as there is a **beetle car painting** and right next to it we can see the **glass** placed on the corner of the room.
  Upon closer inspection on the table, alongside the **cake**, there's a **jar** that holds 2 **flowers**. Next to the jar, you can spot the day's folded newspaper, just like a spiral spring.
